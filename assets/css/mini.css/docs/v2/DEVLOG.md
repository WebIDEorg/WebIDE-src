# mini.css v2.0 Development Log

## 20161012

- Initialized pages for v2.
- Initialized `/scss/v2` directory.
- Initialized `_base.scss` partial file.
- Initialized `/flavors/v2` directory.
- Initialized `mini-default` flavor.
- Initialized `DEVLOG.md`.
- **Started developing base from [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) v5.0.0**
	- Removed support for displaying `[hidden]` in IE 10-.
	- Removed support for the display of `template` in IE. `template` is not supported yet in IE, thus this will not make any difference, as long as the element itself is not yet supported.
	- Removed support for the display of `canvas` in IE 9-.
	- Removed styling fixes for checkboxes and radio buttons in IE 10-.
	- Kept the styling fix for `textarea` that only affects IE. It seems like it could be useful elsewhere as well. **Needs further work!**
	- Removed the `progress` styling fix for IE 9- as the element is not supported in IE 9-.
	- Kept the styling for `svg:not(:root)` although it only affects IE 9-. This is due to the fact that SVG rendering is very important.
	- Removed the `img` style fix for IE 10-.
	- Removed the fix for `audio:not([controls])` which only applies to iOS 4-7.
	- Kept the styling fix of `audio` and `video` for IE 9-, as IE 9 supports both elements.
	- *TODO* Change `mark` color to customized from flavor, override normalized default and fix.
	- Kept styling fix of `dfn` for Android 4.3-, as element is properly supported.
	- *TODO*,*UNCERTAIN* Change the `font-weight` of `b` and `strong` elements to a set number (e.g. 700) to avoid the normalize hack.
	- Kept styling fix for `abbr` in Firefox 39-, as the element is well supported.
	- Kept styling fixes for links (`a`), as they are a core element in all browsers and they should be supported well even in older browsers.
	- Removed the styling fix for `figure` for IE 8. `figure` styling will probably be built from the ground up in the core anyways, so this should not be a problem.
	- Kept styling fixes for `figure` and `figcaption` for IE 9-. These elements are supported by IE 9, but not the older versions of IE.
	- Kept the styling fixes for `article`, `aside`, `footer`, `header`, `nav` and `section` for IE 9-. Elements are only supported in IE 9.
- **Organized and cleaned the base**
	- Merged styling fixes for `article`, `aside`, `footer`, `header`, `nav` and `section` with fixes for `figure`, `figcaption` and `main`.
	- Merged styling for `kbd`, `code`, `pre` and `samp`.
- Started documenting default flavor.

## 20161013

- Started coding variables for base of the framework.
- `background-color` and `color` of `body` are going to be `#f9f9f9` and `#222` respectively (default flavor).
- Defaults for `font-family`, `font-size`, `line-height` remain the same.
- Dropped support for `ms-text-size-adjust` in the `html` element, as mobile IE is not well supported by the framework in general.
- Added `apply-defaults-to-all` flag to apply fonts and styles to all elements except `html`, setting fonts and sizes for the whole document properly.
- Set basic styles for headers.
- Change to the color of `small` elements in headers from `#555` to `#444`.
- Built styling for horizontal rules, fixes apply as before.
- `hr` elements get a margin for left and right (`4px`). This is a design decision for the flavor.
- `hr` top and bottom margins changed to `0.5em` from `0.7em`.
- Removed the `font-size: 1em` for the code elements (`code`, `pre`, `kbd`, `samp`) as they should normally be styled using the first style that applies to `html` and all elements. **Highly suggested to use `$apply-defaults-to-all: true;` always.**
- Added variables for `code`, `pre`, `kbd`, `samp` and a flag for `samp` (`$style-samp-element`) to make sure that no unnecessary styles are added if the `samp` element is not to be used by the developer.
- Added conditions to make sure the least amount of code is used and no defaults are redefined when styling `code`. `kbd`, `samp` and `pre`.
- Changed padding of `pre` elements to `6px` and later to `8px`. Changed color for `hr` to `#666` and later to `#888`.
- Styling and optimization for `small`, `sub` and `sup` elements.
- Changed `font-size` of `small`, `sub` and `sup` elements to `75%`.
- Changed all header `margin`s to be `8px` left and right.
- Added `margin` for paragraphs (`1px` top and bottom and `10px` left and right).
- Specified fancy styling flag (`$horizontal-rule-fancy-style`) for `hr` elements and variable (`$horizontal-rule-fancy-gradient`) to specify linear gradient styling to be used instead of the default `border` styling. This styling supports most browsers, but does not work with IE 9- and Opera Mini. Prefix `-webkit` is added to support some browsers.
- Added variable for bold elements to set `font-weight` manually, so that no problems occur and users can fine-tweak this to their liking.
- Removed fix for `b` and `strong` as the above change addresses the issue.
- `pre` `padding` set to `12px` instead of `8px`.
- Added `overflow: auto;` to `pre` elements so that they are responsive and display properly on all devices.

## 20161014

- Added extra styling option for `small` elements in headers using a flag (`$make-header-smalltext-block`) and two variables (`$header-smalltext-b-font-size` and `$header-smalltext-b-top-margin`) to customize the styling of such elements.
- Minor changes to the way the index page looks for the version 2. Changed tagline and added version codename.
- Added github buttons under title in the index page.
- Optimized the way `small` element styling is applied in headers when it is displayed as a block.
- Added fancy styling for `pre` elements with a flag (`$add-pre-element-sidebar`) and a corresponding variable (`$pre-element-sidebar-style`).
- Added margin for `pre` elements to be in line with paragraphs.
- Changed borders for `pre` elements: left-side borders' `border-radius` is now `0`.
- Changed index, centered title etc.
- Deployed first live demo version of the framework's demo index.

## 20161015

- Updated references to `background-color` and `background-image` to use the `background` shorthand instead.
- Changed palette white from `#f9f9f9` to `#fcfcf` to pass all WCAG tests.
- Added styling for `mark` elements to serve as primary contextual elements.
- Added mixin for `mark` elements (`make-mark-alt-color`) to make variants of the `mark` element (`secondary` and `tertiary`).
- Made color palette for marks, passes all WCAG tests.
- `mark` element styling (`padding`, `margin`, `font-size`, `line-height`) implemented and optimized.
- Optimized `mark` color variant mixin.
- Tweaked values of `mark` color variants to be less strict but still pass the WCAG AA test and most other tests (sometimes they won't pass the WCAG AAA test but that's ok).
- Added mixin for `mark` elements (`make-mark-alt-style`) to make style variants (`tag` and `bubble`). Optimized.
- Added some more text to demo index.
- Deployed live demo index.
- Created svg logo.
- Added logo to demo page.
- Created favicon from logo.
- Added favicon to demo page.
- Changed color palette to use material colors for primary, secondary and tertiary, passes most tests (usually is ok in almost 100% of cases).
- Updated page to test `mark` in headers.
- Deployed live version with updated tags.

## 20161019

- More fiddling with palettes. Tried to update colors to material design: `body` `color` is now `#212121`. `body` `background` is now `#fafafa`. `small` inside header `color` is now `#424242`. Codeblock `background` is now `#e0e0e0` and `pre` sidebar `border-color` is `#1565c0`. `mark` `background`s changed to `#0277bd`, `#f44336` and `#558b2f` respectively.
- Added `display: inline-block` to `mark` alternate styles, to avoid splitting of the element into smaller parts (e.g. broken pills).
- Started styling links. `a` `color` will be `#0277bd` normally.
- Added `background` property to `a` in order to apply underlining using image.
- Added flag for `a` `text-decoration:underline` (`$apply-link-underline`) and checks/optimizations for `font-weight`.
- Removed fixes from Normalize about `a` elements, as they were opinionated and unnecessary.
- Added flag for `a` using fancy `:hover` and other focused effects instead of `color` (`$apply-link-hover-fade`).
- Opened issue for module restructure (#14).
- Module restructure based on issue #14 (partial for whatever work was already done):
	- Renamed `_base.scss` to `_core.scss` and created folder for submodules (`mini-core`).
	- Created `_contextual.scss` for `mark` styling.
	- Comments and sections for core.
- Changed import in flavor, imported contextual in core.
- Corrected and finalized display of `abbr` elements with a `title` attribute: Border fix for older Firefox version was kept, dropped some styling for the underline, underline will now always be normal `text-decoration: underline` on all browsers (opinionated).
- Kept display fix for `audio` and `video` for IE 9, as the elements are supported, moved to top of head.
- Added flag (`$include-dfn-fix`) to enable/disable the fix of `dfn` element on older Android versions based on user preference.
- Disabled said flag, due to hope that when this framework releases, there will be too few people using said older Android versions, so this will not be an issue. Also, `dfn` is not a very commonly used element in a lot of pages, might go unnoticed.
- Moved fix for `svg` in IE at the top.
- Added `TODO`s for other fixes.
- Updated index page, probably broke the live version for a while.

## 20161020

- Added some more comments for enabling and disabling modules from core.
- Browser-specific prefixed properties will now precede unprefixed ones. Changes have been applied.
- Started styling `progress` bars in `mini-core/progess`.
- Since CSS3 transitions are supported unprefixed a lot and mostly older browsers use prefixes, no prefixed versions will be added. Apart from that, if the transitions do not play on older browsers, there will be no significant changes, meaning the experience will be less rich but functionally the same.
- `progress` background set to `#f5f5f5` to achieve a very pale shadow effect. Some users might not see that color difference but that's ok.
- `progress` foreground set to `#01579b` (dark blue from material palette).
- `progress` element tweak added to work in IE 10+. Older browsers will probably default to their original display for the element. This is on intentional (Opera Mini is also not supported).
- Changed conditions for `progress` styling, as the `[value]` attribute did not make a huge difference. Progress elements that do not have a `[value]` attribute will almost always cause trouble on some browsers, no matter what. Thus, it is suggested to set a `value="0"` if possible. Otherwise, Javascript shall be used.
- Opened [question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40149311/transition-for-progress-element-on-value-change) about transitions for progress bars.
- Added mixin for `progress` bars that are inline `make-progress-inline` and used it to create `inline` class for `progress` elements.
- Opinionated `vertical-aling: middle` for said mixin and `display: inline-block` to make sure everything works according to what it should.
- `width` of said mixin's result is specified in `em` (`20em` specifically) to make sure it will work well on all screen and is dependent on text.
- Optimized inline `progress` mixin.
- Added condition for `progress` margin to optimize for `0`.
- Created mixin for color variants of `progress` (`make-progress-alt-color`) and added style imports for `secondary` and `tertiary` elements. Optimized.
- Used slightly different colors from `mark` variatns for `progress` color variants (all material).
- Created mixin `make-progress-alt-style` for style variants of `progress`.
- Created `nano` variant for `progress` (nanobar progress) using above mixin.
- Documented mixins for `progress`, optimized etc.

## 20161021 (last change a bit past midnight but still counts)

- Created `mini-core/grid` for flexbox grid system.
- Opened relevant breaking changes issue (#16).
- Opened issue for `progress` element's transitions on value change.
- Started project for feature backlog on GitHub.
- Created basis for grid system container (fluid only) - `grid`.
- Read a lot of the spec, decided on browser support, coded the `row` basis for the grid system.
- Updated breaking changes issue with more information.
- Added some comments and moved the notes in the flavor file.
- Added set of variables for class names, prefixes, columns, breakpoints etc for grid system.
- Added definitions for extra small screen sizes, using loops etc. Optimized accordingly, tested on local demo.
- Added definitions for small screen sizes, optimized, test on local demo.
- Added definitions for medium and large screen sizes, optimized and tested locally.
- Updated grid definitions to add `$grid-column-padding` so that users can customize the padding for columns.
- Rebuilt demo page from scratch for version 2, added a lot of nice styles etc.
- Updated the edges of the favicon.
- Added grid demo on live page.
- Deployed live demo.
- Added demo docs for progress bars.
- Created `mini-core/table` to build the responsive table module.
- Reorganized variables and imports in order of importance for core and default flavor.
- Added table styling and responsiveness, made customizable etc.
- Added demo table to page, tested.
- Minor consistency reorganization in table module.
- Updated demo page, deployed live.

## 20161023

- Removed `table-layout: fixed;` from tables.
- Added `mini-core/button` and started testing button styling.
- Removed the reset for `:-moz-focusring` (`outline: 1px dotted ButtonText`) for buttons as it was unnecessary and didn't look great.
- Moved fix for `::-moz-focus-inner` to the `button` module.
- Moved generic fix for Android, iOS and Safari to `button` module.
- Removed generic styling reset for `button`, `input`, `optgroup`, `select` and `textarea` based on the fact that the styles are already applied in the first rule `html, *`.
- Split some fixes into generic and button-specific.
- Moved `::-webkit-file-upload-button` fixes to the `button` module.
- Proof-of-concept for `button` module defaults and core, file input is not styled yet (will be done via label hack).
- *TODO* Softcode the `button` module's defaults, add extra styles, classes etc.
- Deployed live demo with hardcoded buttons to test.

## 20161024

- Rebuilt grid system to work with 3 screen sizes instead of 4. Legacy system is now used only if a flag (`$use-four-step-grid`) is enabled.
- Three-step grid breakpoints tweaked to `800px` and `1080px` accordingly.
- Deployed live demo with new grid.

## 20161025

- Issue maintenance and minor changes to issue structure on GitHub.
- Due to implicit labeling (e.g. `<label>Name:<input></label>`) not being correctly handled by some assistive technologies, explicit labels will be used for the `file` `<input>` elements.
- Added `$hide-file-inputs` flag to decide the styling of `file` `<input>` elements.
- Softcoded changes and optimized some things in the `button` module.
- Updated demo page.
- Added and optimized `make-button-alt-color` mixin, created `primary` color variant.
- Added `secondary` and `tertiary` button variants using the mixin. Tested colors.
- Added button overrides for links styled as buttons for `text-decoration: underline` and `&:hover { opacity: 0.75}`. Should now not give away the fact that it's a link.
- Added `make-button-alt-style` mixin, created `small` and `large` style variants.
- Added and tested an entirely custom button style that does something very different compared to the original variants. Variables and mixins included in the flavor file, but are commented out, as they are only used as a demonstration. *TODO* Add a blog post later down the line where I design a full flavor using the files etc., showcasing things like these.
- Forms module started at `mini-core/form`.
- `input` element selection is based on `not:()` selectors instead of straightforward selection as this is more compact in terms of code and allows for non-standard `input`s like `date` types to by easily styled.
- Added a list of `TODO`s in the `form` module, tried some base styling just to make sure everything works.
- Moved style links at the very top of the `<head>` of the page.
- Updated live demo with latest stylesheet (again).

## 20161026

- Added `textarea` and `select` to the `form` `input` styling.
- Added rule for `:not([type="hidden"])`.
- Added `form` element styling (hardcoded still).
- Added demo forms for inline and aligned.
- Modified `input` `background-color` from `#f5f5f5` to `#fafafa`. Changed `background-color` to `background`.

## 20161030

- Opened issue about certain `input` elements.
- Dropped styling for `range` and `color` `input`s.
- Changed form styling a little bit (hardcoded).
- Added styling for `placeholder`s.
- Defined styles for `fieldset`, `legend` and custom class for `input` and `label` grouping (`input-group`).
- Added variables for `form` styling.
- Softcoded most of the stuff for `form` styling.
- Tested `form` styling thoroughly and optimized code.
- Moved fixes from `core` to `form` module for most of the `form` elements (except `search`).
- Deployed updated live page.
- Decided to avoid styling `search` `input` `type`s, due to lack of support for magnifying lens icon for most search inputs. Generally speaking this can easily be added by the user.
- Reorganized the loading order of modules in `core`.
- Added `search` fixes to `form` module.
- *DESIGN DECISION* To deal with accessibility concerns and the very "hacky" way navigation was implemented in the previous version, the following design decisions have been made.
	1. The top menu will be based around the `header` element and will not be able to do `display: fixed`. This will allow content over the fold to appear when important content exists in the menu. Space for a logo and some additional things will be added there.
	2. `nav` will be used as a vertical menu, not `fixed`, that will display any navigational content as required by the user. This is the traditional navigation menu. It will be embeddable in a grid column left or right based on user preference.
	3. Dropdown components will be removed, as the top bar does not need them to work properly and the side bar can be toggled with code.
	4. Sidebar collapsing will not be added as a checkbox hack anymore, but users will be able to use Javascript for that.
	5. An example of Javascript will be added for said collapse.
- All `checkbox` and `radio` elements will be `display: none` by default. Grouping one in an `input-group` with a `label` will give the desired style to the label.
- Created module `mini-core/checkbox`.
- Started styling `checkbox`es and `radio` buttons. Got most of the styling done, hardcoded.
- Updated demo again.

## 20161102

- Updated `checkbox` and `radio` styles for accesibility. Now they are visible to screen readers.
- Added style for `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active` for the `label` elements of the `checkbox` module.
- Added `tabindex` marks for labels in the `checkbox` module demo.
- Added styling for `readonly` and `disabled` for `checkbox` module.
- Updated `checkbox` module and added variables.
- Added issue for flag `use-checkbox-tick-mark` to allow for one of two styles for `checkboxes` and variables according to that. Implementation pending for **v2.1** or similar.
- Minor updates to `button` and `form` for CSS consistencies.
- Added variables for `checkbox` module, optimized a little bit. (Some optimizations do not make sense, like no-border checkboxes and radio buttons, so I omitted them for this reason).
- Added edge case for tabbing to checkbox for `focus`, which will make the `label`'s box `border` glow to the blue-ish shade usually used.
- Removed `readonly` styling for `checkbox` and `radio` as it does not work due to technicalities.
- Updated demo page for `checkbox` module.
- Created `mini-core/navigation` for the navigational components.
- Cleanup in `core`, moved fixes for navigational to proper file, moved leftover fixes to their proper place.
- Added responsiveness for `img`.
- Updated demo page for `checkbox` module.
- Changed `inline` `progress` elements to use `vw` instead of `em`. Fixed a rare bug that would be caused due to that.
- Coded the `header` element's styling. Optimized.
- Made `header` responsive.
- Added demo for `header` element.
- Updated live page for `header`.
- *NOTE* There is some bleedthrough of styles from `button` to `navigation`, specifically for `header`. This is not a problem, but should be noted for further reference/testing etc.
- Extended testing for `header`, there seem to be no bugs.
- Deployed demo page with `header`.
- Added simple styling for `nav`. Created iteration builder for `sublink` and categories tree.
- Tested and optimized `nav`, added demo to `index`.
- Deployed demo page again.
- Added styling and variables for `footer`.
- Changed optimization for links in `footer` and `nav` to not distinguish between `:visited` links and normal ones, style needed reapplication.
- Tested `footer` component styling.
- Added `footer` to the demo page.
- Changed demo page structure to follow the ordering of modules in `core`.
- Tweaked `progress` `inline` to `60vw` instead of `80vw`, should fit more screens properly.
- Added a heading for the `utility` module section in demo page.
- Deployed demo page yet again.
- Created `mini-core/utility` for utilities and helper classes.
- Copied almost verbatim the mixins from *v1* for `make-border-generic` and `make-border-radial-style`. Added variables and calls for mixins in flavor.
- Copied and tweaked `make-breadcrumbs` mixin from *v1*'s extras.
- Changed the way `breacrumbs` are built (use some `em`-based `padding` now instead of some whitespaces).
- Dropped mixin for `make-btn-group`, opened issue (#23) to later build it.
- Added utility mixin `make-hidden` from *v1*, exactly the same.
- Added new utility mixin `make-visually-hidden` for accessible elements that are visually hidden.
- Added `make-floats` and `make-center-block` mixins along with `make-clearfix` mixin from *v1*.
- Explained utilities in demo page.
- Deployed demo page with utilities docs.
- Started developing `shell`. Added `shell` file and `mini-shell/card` file for the `card` module.
- Actually deleted `shell` file, moved everything to `core` file, renamed to `mini.scss`.
- Played around with `card`s a little bit, got a few basic ideas down, tested centering in `row`, not worthwhile.
- Some minor styling for cards has been done, lots of work needed still.

## 20161103

- Added some more info in issue #16 about breaking changes and cards etc.
- Added the proper features needed for media inside `card`s, images and other parts named as media will respond as required and images will resize and center properly. This, in turn broke support for certain browsers.
- Added flexbox properties to cards to `align-self` and `justify-content` so that contents and containers will display properly.
- Created `large` and `small` variants for `card`s.
- Optimized `card`s and added variables etc.
- Tested cards, seem to work properly.
- Minor restructure of `utility` for consistency and such.
- Created mixin `make-card-section-alt-color` for alternate background `card` `section`s. Added a couple of variants just for fluff.
- Opened issue for more mixins to be added to `card` module later.
- Deployed live page.

## 20161104

- Added mixin `make-card-alt-color` to `card` module. Supplied an example of a different card (`primary`).
- Added mixin `make-card-alt-size` for `card` sizes.
- Changed `card`'s `small` and `large` to use above mixin.
- Added `fluid` for `card`s.
- Fixed a bug with `fluid` `card`s, the new optimization and checking routine should work for all percentage-based values.
- Updated demo a little bit to showcase all of the new features of `card`s.
- For consistency reasons (inconsistent `margin`s might cause problems with `card`s of different types), there is no choice to change the `margin` of customized `card`s through via mixin.
- Created mixin `make-card-section-alt-style`, added `double-padded` style to add twice the `padding` to sections.
- Deployed updated demo page.
- Added a new mixin `add-grid-row-cards-alignment` without parameters that allows `row`s to align the elements they contain automatically horizontally.
- Deployed demo again.

## 20161109

- Changed `checkbox` module a little bit to use `floor()` functions to fill the `:after` part, so that everything will look kinda tidier on most browsers. This has been modified after testing on more screens and noticing some minor discrepancies with the way `radio`s are presented.
- Created `mini-shell/accordion` for the `accordion/collapse` module (`accordion` from now on).
- Started styling the `accordion` component.
- *DESIGN DECISION* The `accordion` component will be used both for single collapses and multiple ones.
- Added accessibility to `accordion` component.
- Tweaked the way the `accordion` works to use `transform: scaleY()` so that the `transition` will work with it. Using `height` did not work due to the value of `auto` when content was shown.
- Fixed bug with `clip` and `clip-path` in Chrome for `accordion` module.
- Changed the way `accordion` works to use variables. Optimized code.
- Added demo for `accordion` to the `index` page.
- Tweaked values and colors of `accordion`. Tested in both Chrome and Firefox.
- Added support for `-webkit-` prefix for `transform` to support some browsers.
- Updated demo page for `accordion` with `radio`s as well.
- Added a small section about `tab`s and `carousel`s, just to allow me to test presentation a bit more.
- Deployed demo page with `accordion` demo.
- Added `mini-shell/tab` and `mini-shell/spinner` for the `tab` and `spinner` modules accordingly.
- Created `spinner-dot` class and custom-tailored the `spinner` for that. *NOTE* This spinner does not work perfectly fine with many elements, some tweaking might be required.
- Created `spinner-donut` class and made styling for that `spinner`.
- Added mixin `make-spinner-donut-alt-color` to allow for custom `spinner` styles. No optimizations are applied to this mixin, due to the fact that overwriting the background might cause trouble with the foreground etc.
- Optimized and softcoded most of the `spinner` module's stuff.
- Tested `tab` system for a while, tried out a lot of things, hardcoded demo.
- Fixed a variable naming discrepancy with `$tab-container-name`/`$tabs-container-name`.
- Softcoded `tab` module with variables. Optimized.
- Added responsiveness to `tab` module.
- Tested `tab` module thoroughly on both Firefox and Chrome (PC), will test further on phone.
- *DESIGN DECISION* The `accordion` and collapse module will be merged with the `tab` and carousel module. This is a very well-thought out decision, based on the fact that `accordion` components behave like `stacked` `tab` components. This means that users will be forced to use a heavier module for both components (which might not be beneficial if they only wish to use the `accordion` component), however this helps users mnemonically, by allowing more functionality in one technically identical structure. The specifics of this decision are laid out below:
	1. The `stacked` class will be used for a `tabs` container, so that an `accordion` component can be easily emulated.
	2. Some of the versatility of the `accordion` class will be sacrificed to allow `stacked` `tabs` to include the same functionality. Minor changes can still be made manually.
	3. The `tabs` module will use different transformation tricks for `stacked` and normal tabs. Specifically, the responsive stacked tabs on smaller screens will use preset `height`, while `stacked` tabs will use `height: auto;`.
	4. All controls for both types of `tab`s will be hidden from screen readers to make the content accessible as-is.
	5. The old `accordion` module will be retired and possibly stored in a legacy folder. People that only want that old-school `accordion` module can use it.
	6. `stacked` `tabs` will allow both `checkbox` and `radio` `input`s, normal ones will not allow `checkbox`. This is in line with the philosophy of the two components.
	7. Carousels can still be built using any of the two styles.
	8. `stacked` `tabs` will feature their own color scheme for some things to allow more customization within the module.
	9. Both components will use a generic `:hover` effect.
	10. The `transform`s applied before to `accordion` will still apply to `stacked` `tabs`.
- Refactored code of `tabs` to work with the above decision, removed obsolete artifacts from the `accordion` module.
- Made a few minor tweaks, decided not to add `accordion`-specific styling, as the current styling is just enough.
- Edited the demo page to include most of the new functionality.
- *TODO* Move `accordion.scss` to the `legacy` folder etc.
- Deployed live demo.
- Tested on mobile, found some presentational problems.
- Minor change to the way `transition`s work for `tabs`, they will now all utilize the `transform` implementation.
- Deployed updated live demo page.
- Tested on mobile, works better.
- Minor `tabs` update for `:first-of-type` and `:last-of-type` selectors. This update should fix square top-right corners for single collapses.
- Deployed live demo.
- New module restructure: all modules will be moved to core, some merges might have to be applied (check issue #14). Restructure was applied as follows:
	- Added the functionality of the new `alert` module to `contextual`. Includes mixin `make-alert-alt-color` for different `alert` color variants.
	- Restructured folders. `mini-shell` removed, `mini-core` renamed to `mini`. `mini` is the core folder now.
	- Created branch `v1-neutrino` both locally and on GitHub to support legacy versions in the future. `master` is now the branch for **Fermion** only.
	- Aggressive deletion of older files. The following folder are now gone: `scss/mini`, `scss/mini-extra`, `flavors` except for the contents of the `v2` folder and the folder itself.
	- Renamed `mini.scss` to `core.scss`, moved to the `scss/v2/mini` directory.
	- Deleted `accordion` module file as it was obsolete.
	- Renamed `scss` directory to `src`. Renamed `flavors` directory to `dist`.
	- Moved flavors from their directory to the `src` directory. CSS files produced from flavor files will go to the `dist` folder, along with the minified versions.
	- *TODO* Update the `package.json` and `bower.json` files according to the new framework version.
	- Updated live demo page reference to use the new structure.

## 20161110

- Continued module restructure and cleanup as follows:
	- Code cleanup in `core`, indentation change to tabs for consistency, indentation fixes etc.
	- Started converting media queries from `only screen and ()` to plain `()`. Changes have been applied to `grid` module.
	- Code cleanup in `grid`, indentation etc.
	- Code cleanup in `table`. Media query conversions applied. Optimization.
	- Code cleanup in `form`.
	- Code cleanup in `button`. Updated `file` `input`s to be accessible.
	- Code cleanup in `checkbox`. Optimizations.
	- Restructured `form`, `button` and `checkbox` into one module: `input_control`. Made necessary changes for this to work properly.
	- Code cleanup in `progress`. Merged `spinner` into `progress`. Removed `spinner-dot` from the `spinner` module as it was not a great component.
	- Code cleanup for `contextual`. Minor `mark` optimizations. Added `alert` mixin `make-alert-alt-style` for alternative `alert` styles.
	- Removed `spinner` file.
	- Cleanup for `navigation`.
	- Cleanup for `utility`.
	- Cleanup for `card`. Changed loading order and variables to better reflect the new module system. Updated media queries.
	- Cleanup for `tab`, updated media queries.
- Deployed live demo after cleanup.
- Added modular `box-shadow` to `card`s.

- Added `border-style` and `border-radius` to `mark` contextual defaults.
- Changed `padding` of `mark` elements.
- Added modular `box-shadow` to `alert`s.
- Added modular `box-shadow` for `form`, decided not to add for `fieldset` due to the way it displays and how it sort of clashes with the ideas of material design.
- Added modular `box-shadow` for `button` and button-like elements.
- Added modular `box-shadow` for `header` decided not to add for `nav` and `footer`.
- Added modular `box-shadow` for `progress` element.
- Added modular `box-shadow` for `table` element. Tweaked to be responsive on smaller screens.
- Added modular `box-shadow` for `tabs` container. This might have some minor problems with `border-radius`es.
- Added flexbox-based `button-group` system. Added responsiveness to it and optimized accordingly.
- Deployed live demo with new features.

## 20161111

- Rebuilt `breadcrumbs` from scratch. Uses flexbox.
- Changed `clearfix`, `center-block`, `hidden` and `visually-hidden` from mixins to normal components.
- Changed the appearance of `button-group`, it will now use `border` and `border-radius` more creatively to get rid of unnecessary and excessive styling.
- Added mixin `make-box-shadow-generic` in `utility`, used it to create a class for `box-shadow:none;` just in case.
- Added mixin in `progress` `make-spinner-donut-alt-style` for `spinner-donut` and created `large` variant with it.
- Added extra variables and styles for `grid` reordeing for `first`, `last` and `normal` (reset).
- Deployed demo page.
- Squashed a couple of bugs in header caused by `button` elements and button-likes using `box-shadow` and/or `border`/`border-style`.

## 20161113

- Added `docs/v2/playground.html` to more extensively test some of the components, especially `card`s and more specifically `fluid` ones.
- Added the fix for `fluid` `card`s using `width: auto;` which was supposed to solve some issues (see #31).
- Figured out a new design paradigm for `fluid` `card`s inside `col-` elements: if two separate `div` containers are used, no `card` "spilling" is observed. This could be either a temporary or a permanent solution depending on the complexity of the real issue at hand. However **Fermion** can initially release like this, as the issue is considered controlled and stable for now.
- Removed the old fix from the `index` page, updated as needed.
- Removed a typo in the index page that read `Reponsive`.
- Figured out a good enough solution for the `fluid` `card` problem.
- Pushed the urgent `fluid` `card` fix to all deployed pages.
- Removed the `playground` page as its purpose was fulfilled.
- Closed issue #31 for good.
- Squashed another major bug in the `make-card-alt-size` mixin, stemming from the use of the conditions and logical operators in that. The issue was thoroughly tested and resolved for all cases. `&&` was replaced with `and` in said condition combination.
- Tested some minor color issues with the page's background color and the cards' background color. Made some adjustments, uncertain if I will keep them.
- Added `$table-body-back-color`, `$table-body-fore-color` and `$table-head-fore-color` in addition to the existing `$table-head-back-color` and optimized them accordingly.
- *TODO* Some minor changes to `.button-group` might be needed (button shadows overlapping and existing, the extra border etc.).

## 20161114

- Added the basic setup instructions in the `index` page.
- Added a few links for getting started in the `index` page. Page is complete for now.
- Minor updates to resources, description, title etc, updated `template` as well.
- Added links for the rest of the docs.
- Added browser logos to the table of `index`.

## 20161121

- Changed `grid` breakpoints to `768px` and `1280px` accordingly to better support different resolutions.
- Updated `$button-group-mobile-breakpoint` to `767px` so that it will break on resolutions under `768px` instead of including `768px`.

- Added screen-specific layouts in the `grid.html` doc page.
- Added offsets to the `grid.html` doc page.
- Added reordering to the `grid.html` doc page, `grid` documentation finished - some polishing might still be required.
- Added a rule for `fluid` `card`s inside `col-` elements, allowing the side margins to disappear at the edges of the grid, allowing for better content viewing on mobile. Only for the demo, not in the actual toolkit.
- Changed the value of `$tab-stacked-breakpoint` to	`767px` in line with above changes.
- Added `th` to the accessible hiding rule in the `table` module as a safeguard for different things.
- Heavily edited the `table` module. Desktop view now includes whole ruleset inside the `table` element, so no leaks will happen. Did the same for the responsive part of the module.
- Added support for horizontal and non-responsive tables in the `table` module. Added lots of new variables and rules as needed.
- Tested new `table` module functionality thoroughly. Everything seems to work like a charm, even if the implementation is a little bit fiddly due to flexbox playing some tricks.

- Fixed the way `th` elements display on `vertical` `table`s that contain `th` elements inside the `tbody` by adding a semi-specific rule for the `thead` `th` elements. More specificity caused problems.
- Tested `table` module changes on mobile, Firefox and Chrome.
- Created `navigation.html`.
- Added basic info for `navigation` doc page.
- Added basic structure for `navigation` doc page.
- Added samples for `header`, `nav` and `footer` in the `navigation` doc page.
- Added `box-shadow` to the `nav` element to be in line with the rest of the design. Added a `border`, too.
- Tweaked colors and values of other things in the `navigation` module's variables in the flavor file.
- Updated `navigation` module with optimization and borders.
- Updated all `box-shadow` variable checks to test for `none` instead of `0` as that is the proper syntax used for no shadows. This will help with user-friendliness in customization.
- Added some extra styling to the `header` component, allowing `span` elements to be used as separators between links.
- Added defaults to header at the very top.
- Added description for the `header` component in the `navigation` doc page.
- Added description for the `nav` component in the `navigation` doc page.

- Updated colors and stuff for `button` color variants. They should be consistent now.

## 20161206

- *TODO* Add circular fixed size elements with close and dropdown icon that will change background color from opacity 0.00 to 1 (transitioned) when hovered over, selected, active etc.
- *TODO* Add folder for `v1` in `docs`, keep folder for `v2`. Add an `index.html` in `v2` that will redirect to the main `index.html`, move contents currently in `v2` to main `docs` folder. Move contents of main `docs` folder to `v1` afterwards. This will allow doc pages by version, while being SEO friendly.
- *TODO* Create a cheatsheet page for all the syntaxes for `v2` as a quick and easy guide to find things. Add to main menu.

# v2.1.0 Development log

## 20170106

- Created a new branch for the development of v2.1.0.
- Added `$include-parent-layout` flag, which will allow rows declaring column layout for children.
- Implemented the whole *simple* layout structure for the `grid` module, allowing a `.row` to set the layout of its children, using a `.cols-{SZ}-{WD}` class.
- Decided to include the new `grid` system in the `mini-default` flavor, as its functionality could be beneficial to a lot of people. The new filesize (gzipped) is `6.47KB` over the previous `6.32KB`.
- Added what is basically an *auto-grid* option in `.row.cols-sm` and similar for other sizes, that auto-sizes all columns in a given row. Might come in handy.
- Updated `index.html` to show *under 10KB* instead of *about 5KB* in the **Minimal** card in order to deal with the controversy surrounding this specific line.

## 20170107

- Thoroughly tested `position: sticky` for `header` elements. It seems to work quite fine. - #24
- Tested `position: sticky` for breadcrumbs and other elements. Layout seems to get in the way quite a lot. Implementation might only be viable for `header` elements for now.
- Added `$include-header-sticky` flag and required variables to implement the `.sticky` class.
- Tested a new layout idea in `demo.html`, this is how the new `index.html` should look like in the next update (top part only).
- Updated `index.html` to use the new `.sticky` `header`, along with other styling changes, such as content sizing.
- *TODO* Update the rest of the pages, bump everything to `v2.1.0` and use the local stylesheets in the meantime.
- Content spacing changes in `index.html`.

## 20170108

- Added `$include-footer-bottom` flag, coded the necessary parts for absolute-bottom-aligned `footer` elements. - Resolved #42
- Updated all pages to use the new `footer` absolute-alignment. Should solve some issues on different devices.
- Changed the implementation of the new `footer` to `sticky`, instead of absolute.
- Rolled back all pages that were affected. Should work like a charm now!
- Finalized the `sticky` `footer`.

## 20170113

- Added support for ARIA `role="button"` in the `input_control` module by default. Filesize has bloated to a horrifying 6.92KB.
- Highly optimized `input_control` module's buttons and button groups, by removing redundant selectors, based on specificity, bringing down the filesize to a managable 6.59KB again.
- Optimized `sticky` `footer`s and `header`s a little bit. Should have no effect on filesize.

## 20170116

- Added `$include-horizontal-table` flag in `table` module to conditionally enable/disable the `horizontal` `table`s.
- Updated `breadcrumbs` component in the `utility` module to properly utilize the `ceil()` Sass function, so that no white line errors are shown, effectively fixing the only bug I managed to find with the component's presentation.
- Updated `utility` module's `visually-hidden` to properly do its job.
- First demo of the `tooltip` component. Works properly. Needs some tweaks to display a top and bottom variant, based on user choice.

## 20170118

- `tooltip` added to `contextual` module, minor changes to it, allows both top and `bottom` versions at the same time.
- Updated `tooltip` component to use variables.
- Added mixins for `tooltip`. Tested them.
- Added proper `tooltip` in the `default` flavor. Size now is `6.81KB`. Implementation of issue #41 is now completed.
- `DEVLOG.md` cleanup to make Markdown great again...
- Played with **hugging cat** to prepare it for the update.

## 20170127

- `tooltip` updated, dealing with a small misalignment bug in alternate styles.
- Added `$nav-include-sublink-bar` flag for `nav` element's subcategories to add a sidebar to them. Styled them as necessary and used proper variables. Tested reasonably extensively, no bugs should be present.
- With the addition of the new `nav` sidebar to the main flavor, the file size is now `6.86KB`. This is very close to the final size for the *v2.1.0* release, as most of the new features have been added already.
- Added `label` element `padding` via variables to address certain issues. Tweaked `checkbox` and `radio` components to match changes.
- Added flag for `fluid` `input-group`s and created the related component. `fluid` `input-group`s will now be part of the default flavor, taking the file size up to `6.93KB`, which is probably the final size of the next release. - Deals with #50.

## 20170131

- Added flags for `floats` and `clearfix`, turned both utilites of by default, as they are mostly useless.
- After removing the two components mentioned above, size is now `6.89KB`.
- `center-block` turned off using a flag by default. File size is now `6.87KB`. All legacy utilites have been disabled by default.
- Updated `utility.html` page to reflect the fact that these utilities are no longer present by default.
- Updated `quick_reference.html` to reflect the fact that these utilities are no longer present by default.

## 20170201

- Changed **hugging cat**'s clothes. It's February now!
- Added hidden flag `$input-high-specificity-selectors` to `input_control` to deal with high specificity selectors for `input` elements.
- Tested the new `input` styling, does not seem to cause any trouble with `button`-type `input`s, thus it will probably be the default choice from now on. File size dropped to an astonishing `6.72KB`, which seems like a pretty great tradeoff. Some more tweaks might be required, but this should be mostly fine!
- Tweaked the `input` styling to make sure all `button`-type `input`s are properly styled.
- Added `:hover` and `:disabled` selectors to `input` elements, making sure as many states as possible are covered now.
- Cleaned `:focus:invalid:focus` selector, as I could not find any test cases for it. Size is now `6.75KB`.
- Added safeguard for the `progress` element's `.nano` variant's case with `margin` of `0`. Should now behave properly.
- Added `@supports` statement to help `tooltip` component place itself whenever possible. Changed a few of the selectors in `tooltip` to be as specific as needed and work as required.
- Updated `tooltip` mixin to reflect the above changes.

## 20170202

- Added `[role="button"]` selector for elements inside `header`, did not remove any other selectors from component as specifity would be too low if changed.
- Updated `.card.section` to work properly with `[role="button"]` elements.

- Decided to drop `mini-classic`, not worth it in the long run. See #57 for details.

# v2.1.1 Development log

## 20170329

- Started code cleanup and updating.
- Updated `core` by moving all of the variable definitions and defaults at the top of the module's file.
- Updated both flavor files to deal with the indentation and column problems (only for the `core` module so far). Readability is a lot better, but consistency is a little bit worse. For all intents and purposes, this is the way to go for this release, as the previous styling was impossible to read for the most part in many setups.

## 20170330

- Updated `grid` by moving variable definitions and defaults to the top of the module.
- Updated flavor files, dealing with indentation and readability.
- Updated `navigation` by moving variable definitions and defaults. Added **hidden flag** `$header-colorize-svgs` for a hacky fix that was there before (just in case).
- Updated flavor files, made most multiline comments up to `navigation` into single line comments in order to make the flavor files shorter while maintining readability.
- Added an extra **hidden flag** in `navigation` under `$include-nav-styles` to make sure that `nav` elements can be removed from flavors (possibly not present in the `barebones` flavor).
- Updated `input_control`, splitting into main file and mixins file. Added **hidden flag** `$hide-check-and-radio` and standardized existing one (`$input-high-specificity-selectors`).
- Cleanup and housekeeping for readability in flavor files for updated `input_control`.
- *TODO* Make class naming rules more consistent in module defaults - meaning add all class naming defaults to the very top of all modules, saving time and space when simplified flavors kick in.
- Updated `table` module's definitions and variables, added **hidden flag** `$include-striped-table` in order to make sure `.striped` `table`s can be turned on and off.
- Cleanup of relevant variables and comments in flavor files.
- Updated `card` module, splitting into main file and mixins, cleanup in flavor files for the module.
- Updated `tab` module, adding an extra **hidden flag** `$include-stacked-tabs` for toggling `.stacked` tabs on and off, cleanup of flavor files.
- Updated `contextual` module, splitting file and adding **hidden flag** `$include-alerts` for toggling `.alert`s on and off. Added `@error` messages in mixins in case the mixins are called without the corresponding components enabled. Should be a welcome change during compilation.
- Flavor cleanup for `contextual` module.
- Updated `progress`, splitting file and adding **hidden flag** `$include-spinner-donut` for toggling spinning donuts on and off. Added `@error` messages accordingly.
- Flavor cleanup for `progress` module's updates.
- Updated `utility` module, added proper **hidden flags** to `$include-breadcrumbs` and `$include-close-icon` to make it easier to disable those components.
- Cleanup in both flavor files is now complete, added maintainers to the `mini-sucroa` file to meake it easier for people to reach the team behind it.
- Added simple styling for `figcaption` element in `core`, updated both flavors with the required variables to make it usable.
- After inspecting `grid`, it is clear that no changes will be required at all in terms of variables.
- Minor restructure in `core`'s modules. More might be coming (more defaults - possibly in their own file).
- Updated defaults for `grid` just to be more in line with everything else.
- Updated `navigation`'s defaults to include class name defaults. Added *external variables* in `navigation` to remedy the problems that stem from single module usage.
- Updated `input_control` with new **hidden flag** `$include-button-group` just in case and external variables, plus all the needed class names at the very top.
- Updated `table` module with the required external variables and required names.
- Added external variables to `card`.
- Updated `tab` module with default breakpoint and added external variables as required.
- Added external variables to `contextual`.
- Updated defaults for `progress` module, no externals were needed.
- Added more default values to `utility`. Default and external adding seems complete, I might have missed something, but good enough for now.

## 20170402

- Updated `@media` queries in all modules to utilize `screen`, so that layout changes will only apply to screens (irrelevant in print). `print` stylesheets are coming later down the line and all layouts will print as if in *small* screens (basically `col-sm-...` layouts), to simplifiy everything. Size increased from `6.79KB` to `6.82KB`, worthwhile cost.
- Added resposnive hiding (both normal and accessible) in `utility_mixins` via the `make-hidden-responsive` and `make-visually-hidden-responsive` `mixin`s. Both have as many defaults as possible to make things easier.
- Updated `make-margin-responsive` and `make-padding-responsive` `mixin`s to make sure they are now compatible with four-step grid (legacy).
- Added `.hidden-` and `.visually-hidden-` elements to both flavors via new `mixin`s. Current size for `default` is `6.88KB` gzipped, reasonable tradeoff for a much requested and needed feature.
- *TODO* update documentation pages to showcase the new responsive hiding, add codepen etc.

## 20170403

- Minor update to `input_control`'s code to fix a small problem with it.
- Started developing `mini-lite` flavor (`lite`) as a very lightweight barebones base for the framework, using the default style for the most part. Size is under `5KB` for starters.
- Updated `lite`, removed extra stuff, made it as simple as possible, still under `5KB`.
- Tested `lite` using a quick demo in `Codepen` (*TODO* actually make a demo of it in a Codepen), no problems found, runs great.
- Started documenting the `customization` pages which will serve as a replacement for the old *wiki*. Created `index.html` in the new `customization` folder and added most of the basic info.
- Updated all old navigation links for `Customization` to point to the new folder and its `index.html` page.
- Removed content from old `customization.html` page and added a redirection directive to take visitors to the new page.

## 20170405

- Worked on rebranding quite a lot, set up a mockup of the new logo.

## 20170406

- Updated `index.html` with new logo, all other pages with new brand etc.
- Updated `README.md` and added shields to it.
- Decided to change preferred CDN from `rawgit` to `gitCDN` as it seems more stable and easier to use.
- Opened issue in `cdnjs`'s repo for the library not auto-updating.
- Created mostly empty pages for all modules under `/customization`.

## 20170411

- *TODO* Actually explain what the deal with Pull requests is, using a `dev` branch OR use `cdnjs`, provided the fact that it is now updated to the latest release (will it stay that way?).
- Tweaked the way `border` was used inside `blockquote`, ordering wasn't doing me any favors. Should not cause any problems now. Random catch, thank you **hugging cat**!
- Added `$samp-element-box-shadow` for consistency, mostly.
- Fully documented customization page for `core` module.
- Fully documented customization page for `grid` module.

## 20170412

- Documented `navigation` module's customization page.
- Resolved #63, replacing the `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` properties with the `flex` shorthand. Everything should display properly across browsers now.
- Fully documented `input_control` and `table` modules in terms of customization.

## 20170417

- Merged couple of PRs into `master`, updated `dev211` with the new changes to make sure everything is up to date.
- Dealt with a couple of minor mistakes in existing modules.
- Documented `card` module's customization.
- Added base text and styles for all customization pages not yet finished.
- Documented `tab` module's customization.
- Documented `contextual` module's customization.
- Documented `progress` module's customization.
- Documented customization for `utility` module, finishing developer docs (maybe a proofreading is required, but later).

## 20170418

- Added `nord` flavor from PR, updated `table` module to deal with a minor problem that stemmed from a conditional in it.
- Compiled `nord` flavor and recompiled to make sure everything works properly after the changes.
- Finalized logo and thumbnail.
- Added responsive-hiding classes to `nord`.
- Documented responsive visibility helpers in `utility`.
- Documented `figcaption` element under image responsiveness in `core` module's docs.
- Added codepens and documentation in `quick_reference` for all that was missing.
- Flavor documentation and a couple of minor fixes in `lite`.
- Updated documentation with new cdn options.
- Updated all doc pages to use a `mini-default.min.css` copy placed inside the `docs` folder.
- Added secondary `header` in `modules` page, based on my use-case (I spent a lot of time scrolling while browsing the pages).
- Updated framework sizes and version for front page.


## 20170419

- Added new contributor to README.
- Have **hugging cat** a hug, seemed excited.
- Created templates (6 of them), built `templates` page for showcasing them and added links to it from everywhere.
- Added a list bullet in the `index` page to help people get to the templates more easily.
- Updated `nord` flavor to be fully up-to-date with the latest version of **mini.css**.
- Added maintainers to all flavors.
- Updated CHANGELOG to reflect latest changes for **v2.1.1**.

# v2.1.2 Development Log

## 20170421

- Updated `.npmignore` to not include the `prepros-6.config` file.
- Updated `package.json` with proper `homepage` link, changed order of keywords, added `node-sass` in `devDependencies`.
- Added `::placeholder` styling (no-prefix), dealing with #36.
- Bumped all flavor files to include updated `::placeholder` definitions.
- Updated `.animated` `.alert`s to deal with the way `webkit` renders them (#35).
- Bumped flavors again.
- Updated the way the version tag of the homepage displays (or not) on mobile devices.
- Fixed capitalization for `npm` in all pages, updated version tag everywhere (hopefully), getting ready for **v2.1.2**.
- Updated flavor files with latest version tag.
- Checked `yarn`'s packaging, all systems nominal, added to download options.
- Updated CHANGELOG and README.
- Fixed a couple of problems in doc pages post-release, added secondary navigation to `quick_reference`.

# v2.1.3 Development Log

## 20170427

- (Updated a few minor things in doc pages in the last week.)
- Created a `demo.html` under `docs` to test flavor redesign.
- Reworked a lot of the default flavor's colors. It should now look less flat and a little bit more rich in terms of coloration, making it more aesthetically pleasing.
- Font ratio set to `~1.189207` for heading elements, should now look more consistent and pixel-clean.
- Cleaned up a lot of the code and started using `rem` and more `em` than percentages and pixels whenever possible.
- Removed underline from `nav` links.
- Updated `card` module, removing the specific fix for `input` and `button` elements and replacing it with a more generic solution that can work for any element (so now `pre` `.section`s will look ok).
- Removed `box-shadow`s from everything, because nobody liked them.
- Changed `.tooltip` `top` and `bottom` to `75%` from `100%`, in order to bring it closer to the text.
- After full internal testing, removed the `demo.html` file.
- Developed `mini-dark`, some tweaks might be required, but overall color palette seems good.
- Updated `.tooltip`, effectively breaking support for certain older browsers (some old version of Chrome mostly) and removing the `@supports` query, saving a little bit of space, as most browsers now do in fact support the `calc` directive. Also, added `left: 50%` for older browsers, allowing tooltips to work a little bit better on legacy systems.
- Did pretty much the same for `progress`'s `width` property, cleaning up some space. The `width` will now default to `90%` so hopefully no trouble for older browsers as well.
- Broke support of `hr` for older browsers, as the `-webkit` prefix is now representative of a tiny fraction of users.
- Changed `transition` properties to not use `-webkit` prefix anymore. Also changed them, removing `ease` and `0s` for `transition-timing-function` and `transition-delay` repsectively, allowing the browser defaults to apply (which are the same, so nothing lost there).
- Changed `transition` of `a` and `buttton` elements to `opacity` from `all` for higher specificity.
- Tested aforementioned changes, everything seems to work ok. Size of `default` flavor is now `6.71KB` compared to a `6.89KB` in previous release. Pretty sweet reduction.
- Built sidebar navigation into modules pages.
- Tweaked color of `button` elements slightly to look less terrible.

## 20170428

- Checked online if support for old `flexbox` syntax can be removed, but due to **UC Browser** (~9% of the market) it cannot. Shame really, because it's the only browser that needs it, all other legacy browsers have a low market share or are already deprecated due to other changes. Thus, we keep the old syntax, but a flag might come later down the line for people who don't care about legacy and UC. Also, the `-webkit` prefix for the newer syntax is still needed in many modern-ish browsers, so no changes in that department, either. At least, I checked.
- Fixed the extra tabbing in `core` module documentation.
- Added better module descriptions in `modules.html`, updated the way their cards look, everything should look cleaner and better now.
- Updated `flavors.html` page, removed latest version, because it was not really all that useful. Flavors that are not updated can just list it in their description now.
- Updated all Codepens to use `https://gitcdn.link/repo/Chalarangelo/mini.css/master/dist/mini-default.min.css` instead of version-specific files. That was tiresome!
- Removed version from `README.md`, the npm shield has it listed, so no need to list it again!
- Updated `mini-lite` to use the latest ruleset and colors from `mini-default`.
- Added sidebar navigation for `\customization` pages, updated them all.
- Added template for login forms.
- Updated front-page a little bit, adding logos and changing the content around a little bit.

# v2.1.4 Development Log

## 20170503

- Started validating the HTML pages with the W3C Validator, making sure to fix as many issues as possible.
- Fixed 7 errors in `index.html`, 5 error in `flavors.html`, 2 errors in `core.html`, 2 errors in `grid.html`, 9 errors in `input_control.html`, 4 errors in `table.html`,  3 errors in `card.html`, 4 errors in `tab.html`, 7 errors in `templates.html`, 2 errors in `utilty.html`, all errors in the customization docs stemming from `width="100%"` in `table` elements, 5 errors in `customization\card.html`, 20 errors in `customization\navigation.html` (~100 errors in total).
- Extensive validity checking for the CSS codebase, no real issues that can be solved, due to most being part of the `WD` or `REC`, so they will be resolved on their own over time.
- Some testing and work on how to simplify certain rules has taken place. Honestly, some rules are too high-specificity, maybe a *loose* definitions flag is in store for later releases.
- Checked page mobile-friendliness and speed, removed the `Noto Sans` link from the `head`, added as rules inside the pages to improve loading speed.
- Updated the `index.html` of customization to make sure that mobile users have a menu they can use for the section (using a `.button-group`).

## 20170504

- Minor grammatical fix in `navigation` docs.
- Started working on the removal of useless `:active` styles. Links and anythng affected by them will be styled based on a flag, while anything that is not a link, will be dealt with separately to make sure no excess styles are left (these were quite the problem in terms of size, so dealing with them is a priority). Extensive list of changes:
  - Added `$style-link-active-state` in `core` as a *hidden flag*, updated code.
	- Added the *external flag* `$style-link-active-state` to navigation, updated code.
	- Completely removed the `:active` styling from checkboxes and radio buttons (`input_control`).
	- Separated the classes that apply to `<a>` elements in `input_control`, moved their `:active` styling behind the *external flag* for active, effectively removing all excess styling from the other elements (this should improve their code a lot).
	- Updated `input_control_mixins` to separately stylize the `:active` pseudo-class of `<a>` elements affected by the produced classes.
	- Completely removed the `:active` styling from the `tab` module, as it was applied on `<label>` elements, which was unnecessary.
	- Used *external flag* to make sure that `.tooltip`s are stylized only if needed (`contextual`).
	- Used *external flag* to make sure that `.close`s is stylized only if needed (`utility`).
- Moved all mixin `@import` statements after each modules variables have been initialized.
- After working on `:active` redefinition, the size is now `6.53KB` gzipped (previously `6.71KB` gzipped).
- Fixed a typo in `core`'s code, nothing was really affected, but it's nice to have it fixed.
- Optimized certain pieces of code in the `grid` module, including the pre-defined layouts in shared rules, actually saving a little bit of space. Size is now `6.50KB`, a noticeable improvement over the previous size.
- Dramatically improved `input_control`'s `.button-group` styling, by reworking the way the combinatory selectors (`element + element`) inside it work, based on the fact that we are just styling the last element and we don't care about what the previous one was. This shaved off quite a lot of size, shrinking `mini-default` down to `6.37KB`. **Hugging cat** is especially happy with this.
- Tried improving `:checked` styling for checkboxes, radios and `.tabs`, but decided it was not worth the lack of specificity due to very little space saved in reality.
- Updated doc layout for consistency and better display on most screens.
- Updated custom `border` styling for docs to be consistent in terms of coloring.
- Made margins and spacing for most pages more responsive to make things easier to view on mobile.
- Updated version tag in everything.
- Updated `CHANGELOG` to reflect the latest changes. Ready to release (tomorrow morning).

# v2.1.5 Development Log

## 20170505

- After some quick tests, `@media print` styling will not be developed for now and might actually not be developed at all, as no requests have been made for it. I might add print styling to the requested modules list, so that someone else can implement it in the future.
- Last release failed, re-released as 2.1.5!

# v2.2.0 Development Log

## 20170508

- Embedded the intro that Per Harald Borgen built for the framework in the front page (`index.html`) under the `Quick overview` heading (I think it fits quite nicely).
- Added Per Harald Borgen to the list of contributors to show my gratitude.
- Removed old classes produced using the generic shadow mixin in `utility`, replaced with `.shadowed` to let developers still have some generic shadow class. Updated docs as needed, codepens will be updated right before release.
- Updated the definitions of the responsive visibility helpers to utilize `!important` properly. Size is now `6.34KB` which seems pretty good, based on the fact that some of the existing components that are being removed were unused by most devs to begin with.
- Removed the `.nano` progress bar, as it served no real purpose. **Hugging cat** misses it already, but it had to go, don't judge. Size should be smaller but the tool I use (Refresh-SF) has crashed and I can't really check the gzipped size right now.

## 20170510

- Tonight's the night: Lots of updates and changes will be taking place (hopefully), as the next release needs to be fast-forwarded for a lot of reasons. Let the building begin.
- Updated the `.close` icon with the new styling, making it less complicated, using a Unicode character instead of custom pseudo-elements, size is now `6.24KB`.
- Removed `.inverse` class from card, added `.warning` and `.error` instead (part of the `.alert` migration system).
- Updated `quick_reference` for said changes to `card` module.
- Created new codepens for the `quick_reference` page for changes in the `card` module.
- Forked old codepens that used `.nano` and `.shadow-...` classes, updated links in `quick_reference` for all of them now.
- Updated both `mini-default` and `mini-dark` to use the latest classes built in the `card` module with proper colors.
- Deprecated `.alert` and all that comes with it, updated flavors to reflect this. I will update all docs after commiting, just to be on the safe side. By the way, `mini-default` is now `6.12KB` without the deprecated components and with a few of the additions already built-in. Pretty happy with how it's coming along right now!
- Updated docs just barely to make sure that the new `.toast` component will easily find a suitable home in them.
- Implemented `.toast` quite quickly and without doing too much work on it, seems to work pretty well. Documentation, mixins and customization not yet done.

## 20170511

- Added `.toast` mixins to make them customizable.
- Added `.large` and `.small` size variants for `.toast` elements.
- Added `z-index` to `.toast` elements, so that they display above everything else so far.
- Documented `.toast` changes in their page. Updated the documentation in `quick_reference`. Created related codepen (bit fiddly but should be ok).
- Updated `customization` for the new `.toast` component, fixed some mistakes I found in the `customization/contextual.html` page.
- Updated flavors for `.toast`:
	- `mini-default` fully supports it.
	- `mini-dark` fully supports it.
	- `mini-lite` does not support it (in keeping with tradition of the lite flavor's decisions).
	- `mini-nord` still uses `.alert`s instead of `.toast`s, maintainer should address after update, otherwise I will in the next patch or so.
	- `mini-sucroa` does not support it (or `.alert` for that matter), might be addressed with author later down the line, for now it's ok to not have either.
- Changed order of `input_control` and `navigation` for all flavors and documentation pages.
- Thoroughly tested fluid typography and updated the `core` module with the required variables and flags. This added a little bit of extra size to the framework, but it seems worthwhile as it scales a bit better on smaller screens, so that there is slightly more real estate for content.
- Updated all flavors for fluid typography (basically only `default` and `dark` actually use it for now).
- Updated `core` module documentation and customization documentation to explain fluid typography.
- Fixed the `header` element bug that didn't allow them to work well with the `.row` class for responsive layouts. They should now display as expected.
- Disabled fluid typography by default, it needs more testing and the `14px` font in smaller screens doesn't sit well with me. The feature is still there for those who want it.
- Implemented `.drawer` component along with everything that it needs. Documentation pending.
- Tested `.drawer` on the `modules.html` page, it seems to work pretty well.
- Documented `.drawer` component, updated descriptions wherever possible, the customization documentation will be added in later.

## 20170512

- `$include-drawer` is now a *hidden* flag.
- Updated `.drawer` to include a `$drawer-box-shadow` just in case.
- Updated customization for the new `.drawer` component.
- Updated `mini-default`, `mini-lite` and `mini-dark` for the new `.drawer` component, the other two flavors will be updated later today.
- Updated `quick_reference` for `.drawer`, added a codepen for the component.
- Updated `index.html` with mobile menu, updated tags to latest version. Fixed the way the screencast displays, so that it fits nicely on smaller screens.
- Updated all module pages to use `.drawer` on mobile.
- Updated `flavors.html` and `templates.html`, both now use the new menu and the tags are updated for the flavor doc.
- Updated `quick_reference.html` with new navigation, new tag, checked everything.
- Updated menus in all `customization` pages.
- Updated `mini-nord` to use the new components.
- Added screencasts to `core` and `grid` modules, so that people get a better starter.
- Added `$drawer-border-radius` for constistency.
- Updated `mini-sucroa` to use the new components.
- Updated all templates to display perfectly after all the change.
- `mini-sucroa` demo didn't need any updates, `mini-lite` required the removal of the `nav` element which was an artifact (whoops!).
- The other two flavors will be updated to include the new elements and get rid of any problematic stuff (will update in a bit).
- Updated flavor descriptions in `flavors.html`.
- Everything is ready for release, let's write the `CHANGELOG` for **v2.2.0**. (A couple of templates and things might be done later today, as well as linking to them from certain components such as the `.drawer` which could benefit from that.)
- Updated `CHANGELOG`, readying up for release. See you and **hugging cat** on the other side!

# v2.2.1 Development Log

## 20170522

- After taking a break, started updating the documentation. Added the sample website codpen project to the `templates.html` page to help newcomers get started.
- Added a small prompt for starring from the homepage.
- Added an exclamation mark next to Edge in the `index.html` page to make sure people read the note.
- Justify-aligned all paragraphs of text in documentation pages.
- Fixed a couple of mistakes in the documentation pages.
- Updated `navigation`'s `.drawer` documentation with better notes and examples.

## 20170530

- Added a note in `core` doc to tell people about fluid typography.

- Fixed a typo in `table`.
- Fixed a typo in `input_control`.

# v2.3.0 Development Log

## 20170605

- Updated packaging information etc. (structural updates for next release)
- Spent a long while, but found the icons to replace the front page's style:
	- http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/wings_262678 (Feather)
	- http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/bacteria_191004 (Bacteria)
	- http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/meteor_433944 (Meteor)
- Updated colors for `<pre>` and `<code>`, along with `<button>` and some other elements to better contrast colors on older and less bright displays. Updated both `mini-default` and `mini-lite` to fix issues with those colors.
- Altered default height of `<progress>` elements to `0.625rem` from `1rem`, should look more modern and sleek. Updated both core flavors.
- **State check for all modules and implemented components** (CSS variables - #19 - not included in features checked):
	- `core` - Most likely **100% complete**, fluid type will *not* be enabled by default anytime soon. Everything else is fully nominal.
	- `grid` - Everything works as expected, **no changes** to existing components. Possible addition of a couple of atomic css classes to make everything smoother.
	- `input_control` - **Requires testing** for `.input-group` and other components. **New component**, `.switch`es must be added.
	- `navigation` - **100% complete**, should be checked against the new additions to other modules to make sure everything works as expected.
	- `table` - **New component**, `.scrollable` tables should be added. Everything else should be fine.
	- `card` - Everything is fine, **no changes**, should check for compatibility with `grid`'s new atomic css and/or build in-module ones, too.
	- `tab` - Most likely **no changes**, might test to see if more modern styling can be applied to the module's component.
	- `contextual`- **New component**, `.modal` should be added. Nothing else of note here.
	- `progress` - **100% complete**, some fancier components such as Android-styled spinner donuts might be coming later down the line, but they will be flavor-customized.
	- `utility` - **No changes** to existing components, however some additions might be required to make everything play as expected.
- Refer to above list in regards to the #19 feature request.
- Reworked complex `tab` module selectors to utilize the functionality of `:not(:first-of-type)` on `label` elements.
- Updated `tab` selectors to use new, *loose* definitions, effectively making the module `0.04KB` lighter. Not a huge difference, but good enough due to the maintenance impact it has on the module, plus the consistency fixed for `.stacked`.
- Moved `input_control`'s `disabled` styling to low-specificity behind the existing flag, saved another `0.05KB`, which is quite a big change. Parsing should also be faster than before. Good catch, **hugging cat**!
- Lowered specificity of selectors used in `.button-group` for styling `border`s, cut off another `0.02KB`.
- Added styling for `:disabled` on `checkbox` and `radio`, pushed the size back up a little bit.
- Merged some styles in `contextual` in regards to `.tooltip`.
- Changed `table` selectors to use `:not(:first-child)`, similarly to other modules.
- All changes have been tested and no errors were found (as far as I can tell).
- Created the `.modal` component, added to the `default` flavor, documenting and adding to other flavors pending.
- Updated all flavors for the new `.modal` component to be included (or not) as needed.
